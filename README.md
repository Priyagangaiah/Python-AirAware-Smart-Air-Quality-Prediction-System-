# Python-AirAware-Smart-Air-Quality-Prediction-System-
A Python project to predict air quality using environmental data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, NO₂). It forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollution level, helping raise awareness about health and the environment.
# Problem Statement
Air pollution affects health and environment. Predicting air quality helps people take preventive measures.

# Objective
To predict air quality levels using machine learning techniques based on historical data.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
# Dataset
Air quality dataset with parameters like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO.

# System Architecture
Input Data → Preprocessing → ML Model → AQI Prediction → Output

# How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Future Scope
Real-time AQI prediction
API integration
Mobile application
